      <h4>the civilization florish in the jungle</h4>
    <p>Built by the Chachapoyas, the fortified citadel of Kuelap was home to the Warriors of the Cloud in Peru before they were conquered by invaders. Massive stone walls and hundreds of ruins stand as a reminder of a formidable culture lost to history. The impressive nature of the Kuelap ruins explains why it is sometimes referred to as Peru's Second Machu Picchu.<br><a href="https://apulodge.com">Visit Apu lodge</a></br></p>

      <h4>Kuelap's impenetrable fortresses</h4>
      <p>  Amazonas was the cradle of one of Peru's major pre-Hispanic cultures: the Chachapoyas. It was here that ancient people built Kuelap, an imposing stone structure protected by an outer wall up to 20 meters high, situated at the top of a mountain amid a rugged landscape. Until recently, the only way to reach this archaeological site was on foot. 
 
        Today, the site can be reached in 20 minutes, thanks to a modern cable car that leaves from Nuevo Tingo. <br><a href="https://pachaperuexplorers.com">Pacha Peru expeditions</a></br></p>

      <h4> The mysterie of the town in the sky</h4>
      <p>Some of the most famous archaeological remains left by the Chachapoyas are the purunmachu sarcophagi where they placed the remains of the deceased high up on cliff ledges. The process to make the purunmachu took a series of steps: First, clay was sculpted around the carefully wrapped bodies of the dead. Then a mixture of mud and straw was applied. Finally, the sarcophagi were painted cream colored of white and decorative details such as necklaces, feathered tunics, and faces were painted on in yellow and red. When placed on a ledge of a high cliff, the sarcophagi look like sentries guarding the dead.<br><a href="https://leadingperutravel.com">Visit Leading Peru travel</a></br></p>
